## What is the AdventOfCode?

To quote from the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about):
> **Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
